## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive UI components.
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing.
- **ShadCN**: For pre-styled UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For efficient and customizable styling.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: For leaderboard storage.
- **TypeScript**: To enable static type checking and better code quality.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add a leaderboard using AWS DynamoDB to store player scores.
- Implement additional grid sizes (e.g., 4x4, 5x5).
- Create animations for tile movements.

---

## Setting Up AWS Leaderboard

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:

```env
AWS_REGION=your-region
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
```

Replace `your-region`, `your-access-key-id`, and `your-secret-access-key` with your AWS credentials.

### 2. Setting Up DynamoDB Table

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Navigate to **DynamoDB > Tables**.
3. Create a table named **`puzzle-leaderboard`** with:
   - **Primary Key**: `uuid` (String).
4. Add a **Global Secondary Index (GSI)** if required for advanced sorting.
